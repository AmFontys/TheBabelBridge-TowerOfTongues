# The Application Cafe

## What is it

This is a room where students that can't get an internship can go to to help them get an internship. The main objective is to help the student with getting an internship with improving their CV, motivation, where they should look and preparing for a talk.  
This is open every tuesday from 15:00 till around 16:30 in the Fontys R10 building.

## Why did I go there

I went to this café because I couldn't get an internship and tried to find a possible reason why I couldn't find one.
Furthermore, I couldn't get quite the idea on everything that would be discussed.

I will go again to possibly rehearse before I have meeting with a company in person or via the telephone. This is possibly one of my weaknesses unknowingly as I focus on parts about what the company likes to hear while staying with the truth.  
As this part about the introduction I find a bit difficult as I have some information about the company but the person itself is still a bit of a mystery.

## The Feedback

In this part I will discuss parts of feedback I got based on what I showed in the session of 10 June. In this session I was the only student for the entire period so I got personal feedback.

### General Feedback

I could use Linkedin more make some posts about like "i'm searching for an graduation internship" and things what I'm currently working on. Also making more connections and possibly search for graduation internship vacancies on it.

For searching for an internship I look at Partners In Education Fontys, Fontys ASAM, Indeed and StageMax. For some explanations about these are `Partners In Education Fontys` is companies that are stakeholders in projects for Fontys students and also help in other ways like giving a workshop to better students skills in an area. `Fontys ASAM` is the system from Fontys that companies can give internships to students.

The Café leader finds this fine and that I should not entrust StageMax with all the finding of internships and that I also should look myself.  
I also should talk with a person that I know in the `Lectoraat` to possibly find me an internship there or which available vacancies can fit with my goal wherein I want to graduate in.

### Specific Feedback

With my CV although I show the specialization and minor I did, I could possibly include what I did for that but is not needed as it can be also talked about in the motivation letter and possibly in the meeting itself with the company.  
Although, this was a good idea I find it will create a busy section so it will be considered but not definitely added.

Another part of the CV is the skills I show as this is mostly the programming languages and cloud I know and how good I think I'm at it. I got feedback from companies that they like this but the person leading the cafe found that this could also be excluded as this clutters the CV also. Furthermore soft-skills are not in the CV other then in the short introduction and this could also be included. But some of these soft-skills are in my Linkedin profile.

I had also some minor grammatical errors like "backend is my preferred choice of work" -> "I like to work in the backend" as an example.  

## Concluding

In conclusion I should send an email / team message to the person in the `Lectoraat` that I know, on linkedin a post with that I'm looking for a internship but this would mean I need to also create a bigger connection.  
I also just need to keep applying to companies and making motivation letters for them.  
Then because I started with Career JumpStart I should follow or at least discuss with them with what I'm doing, where I can apply and what help I need, looking over my CV and motivation letter.  
Also that I can and possibly should go to this cafe again to see other students, get in person feedback and hear what troubles there are.
