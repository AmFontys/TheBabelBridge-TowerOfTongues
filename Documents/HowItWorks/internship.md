# How I look for internships

## Where do I look

I look at the following places:

- ASAM
- Indeed
- PartnersInEducation
- StageMax
- GraduationConference

In these I look for graduation internships that I want to do and fit what I can do.

## What I do per company

I look per company what do they do and where are they located. If I think the match with what they do don't match with what I can do or want to do then I won't look further and skip over the company because if I don't feel the match the company likely also doesn't.  
Furthermore if it's far away but they have housing options or enough money to rent a place nearby then I can apply for it but I can still be rejected because of time to travel although I make clear that I plan to come closer.

Then if I find it fitting I look for their vacancies or apply via email. When no answer is given a week later then I request an update and then still no answer I think I'm rejected.

## The phases of the internship

For me I have the following phases that I keep track of with looking and progress of the internship applying:

- Requested internship
- Not answered for a week
- Planned call or meeting
- Waiting for acceptance or rejection
- Rejected

## Why it didn't work out

Most of the rejected internships where there was a better candidate. Or another was we have planned to take somebody that is a bit closer. These are things I couldn't do much with so I accepted it.  
With one company `Geld.nl` I messed it up because I was saying 2 things that it's either together that we formulate the internship or that they need to wait to hear back and that I was not sure. But, the writing wasn't what they expected so they didn't go further with me.  

## What I did to help me

After a period of time I applied to StageMax a company that is between a student and a company. They look for if there is a match or not and how you can make sure that you can get an internship.  
When this was also not working I heard from a teacher later down the line that there was also CareerJumpStart which can help me. This is something I immediately applied for and I'm currently in the works with.
