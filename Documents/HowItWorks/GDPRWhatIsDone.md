# GDPR Compliance – What Is Done

## Article 5 – Principles Relating to Processing of Personal Data

A privacy statement is provided, explaining how user data is handled and how users can request access to their data. Data minimization is practiced: only data necessary for the application's operation is collected and retained.

## Article 6 – Lawfulness of Processing

Personal data is processed only when necessary for the functioning of the application, such as for user authentication or saving user preferences. No unnecessary or excessive data is collected.

## Article 7 – Conditions for Consent

Users are informed about data collection and must provide explicit consent before any personal data is processed. Consent can be withdrawn at any time by contacting support, as described in the privacy statement.

## Article 8 – Conditions Applicable to Child's Consent

Account creation is restricted to users above the minimum age required by GDPR. If a user is identified as a minor, parental consent is required before processing any personal data. The project may be targeted at children as a language learning game, but appropriate consent is always ensured.

## Article 12 – Transparent Information, Communication and Modalities for the Exercise of the Rights of the Data Subject

Clear and accessible information about data processing and user rights is provided in the privacy statement. Users are informed about how to exercise their rights and contact support for any data-related requests.

## Article 13 & 14 – Information to be Provided Where Personal Data Are Collected from the Data Subject / Not Obtained from the Data Subject

At the time of data collection, users are informed about what data is collected, the purpose of collection, and how it will be used, as described in the privacy statement. The only third party involved is the Azure email service, which is used solely for sending notification emails (such as account verification or breach notifications). No personal data is shared with other third parties or used for purposes beyond those stated.

## Article 15 – Right of Access by the Data Subject

Users can request access to their personal data by contacting support, as outlined in the privacy statement. Upon receiving a request, we manually verify the user’s identity and provide a summary of the stored data within a reasonable timeframe.

## Article 16 – Right to Rectification

If users notice incorrect or outdated information, they can contact support to request corrections. If the correction cannot be made through the provided functionality, we review and update the data as soon as possible after verifying the request.

## Article 17 – Right to Erasure (‘Right to be Forgotten’)

Users may request the erasure of their personal data by contacting support. Instead of deleting the account entirely, we anonymize the account by replacing the username and other identifiable information with random values. This approach allows us to retain the crossword puzzles and maintain a history of activity for analytical or system integrity purposes, while ensuring that the data can no longer be linked to the individual.

## Article 18 – Right to Restriction of Processing

Users can request that we temporarily restrict the processing of their data (for example, if they contest its accuracy). Such requests are handled manually by support and processed as soon as possible.

## Article 20 – Right to Data Portability

Upon request, we can provide users with a copy of their personal data in a commonly used digital format (such as CSV or JSON), delivered securely via email.

## Article 21 – Right to Object

Users can object to certain types of data processing (such as marketing communications) by contacting support. We review and honor such requests promptly.

## Article 25 – Data Protection by Design and by Default

Data protection is integrated into the system design. Only necessary data is collected, and access is restricted to authorized personnel. All data is stored securely in an Azure database located in North Europe. Privacy practices and security measures are reviewed regularly.

## Article 26 – Joint Controllers

No personal data is shared with third parties or partners. The application is the sole controller of all personal data. Azure email service acts only as a processor for email delivery and does not access or use personal data for other purposes.

## Article 31 – Cooperation with the Supervisory Authority

We are prepared to cooperate with supervisory authorities if contacted, and will provide any required information or assistance as needed.

## Article 32 – Security of Processing

Data is protected using Azure’s built-in security features, including encryption at rest and in transit, as well as access controls. We regularly review our security settings, conduct access reviews, and apply updates as needed.

## Article 33 – Notification of a Personal Data Breach to the Supervisory Authority

A process is established to notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach. Each breach is assessed and documented according to GDPR requirements.

## Article 34 – Communication of a Personal Data Breach to the Data Subject

If a data breach occurs, all users will be notified by email without undue delay.

## Article 44 – General Principle for Transfers

Personal data is stored exclusively in an Azure database located in North Europe and is not transferred outside the EEA.
