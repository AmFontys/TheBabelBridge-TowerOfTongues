# Choosing the right tools for development

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### What NFRs do I have

### How can I know that it will fit the NFRs

## Which Frameworks to use

But when is a selection a good fit? Picking the best framework for developing an application (or a set of frameworks), means trying to find the best trade-off between eg the following criteria:

Range of Applicability – what part of the application can be developed using the framework? Do I need a set of frameworks or just one?
Development Speed – how fast will development go? What about maintainability?
Manageability & Flexibility – what would be architectural and performance limitations? Any other?

Choosing the right framework (or set of frameworks) for developing an enterprise application is not just about surfing the Internet for “top frameworks for an enterprise software solution”.

First of all, it’s about determining the right mix of Range of Applicability, Development Speed and Flexibility & Manageability that meets the requirements of your project.
When that mix is clear, you can focus on selecting a framework within the desired approach category. Determine additional criteria that might be important to your project: e.g. preferable programming language, size of the community, quality of vendor support, success stories, and so on.
Using the requirements of your project, determine your own mix of criteria using the info above. Define a shortlist of frameworks that you think has the highest chance to match the requirements (see list below as inspiration). Analyze the pros and cons of each framework in relation to the project.
A structured way of doing this is as follows:

Define a number of selection criteria; Criteria can have a weight, which indicates how important the criterium is for your solution. Examples of selection criteria are:
Does it meet your functional requirements?
Cost of the product
License constraints
Maturity of the product & Product roadmap quality
Active community & support options
Documentation quality
Does it support the expected load (users, requests, data volume, etc.)
Ease of use
Select a number of possible choices (tools, frameworks, products, etc.)
Give scores to the defined selection criteria, and evaluate the chosen products, in a matrix as below.
