Note down in a structured format (mindmap, bullet points, essay, etc.) your thoughts about this. What questions do you have and would like an answer to? What weak and strong skills have you identified in yourself? What is your outlook on the future? What are typical companies you would (or wouldn't) like to work for? These questions are but some examples of what is worth thinking of. Be honest with yourself.
