# Design Oriented Research: Plan

## The Problem

The problem that I want to solve is how you can generate a crossword with multiple alphabets.  
This is something I want to solve because it shows how you can handle multiple languages and alphabets. Furthermore because not everybody uses latin characters it can be used by more people and can create culture connections due to it in the sense of solving crosswords made by people from that culture can help you understand it better. An example of this is `sushi`, you can write in hiragana as `すし` in katakana it's `スシ` and kanji as `寿司` or `鮨`, these are quite the few ways to write `sushi`<sup>[2](#links)</sup>.

## Research Questions

How can a crossword generation system be designed to effectively support multiple alphabets, enhancing language learning and cultural exchange?

1) What kinds of alphabets are there and which do I want to support
2) How does a program/website handle multiple alphabets
3) What design considerations do I need to keep in mind
4) What are the potential benefits of using crosswords as a tool for language learning and cultural exchange?
5) How can data be stored and processed to accommodate multiple alphabets?

## Methods to use

Some of the methods<sup>[1](#links)</sup> I will think I need will be written down under the pattern that I will follow. With under that for what research question (globally) I plan to use it for.  
The numbers under the explanation are the sub questions that I think will be solved by it.

- Realize as an expert
  - Literature study
    - Mainly for finding alphabets and design considerations.
    - I will look for basic information and consideration that are available
    - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Community research
    - Mainly for finding the benefit of using the crosswords and handling multiple alphabets.
    - In this I will look at community forums/website on what others did and why they did these things
    - 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Brainstorm
    - With this method I will think of things that I can try to make and need to solve my problem.
    - 1, 3, 4, 5
  - Prototyping
    - With this is actually trying to do the things I did with Brainstorm and study/research that I did.
    - 2, 3, 5
  - Ethical Check
    - The point for this one is to make sure that I don't make any mistake with cultural considerations that I implemented.
    - The cultural consideration come from both the study and research besides what is commonly known for these cultures.
    - 3, 4
  - Guideline conformity analysis
    - Following a guideline on the best practices and laws and standards that come with making a multi-lingual website.
    - 1, 2, 3, 5

## Delivery and Estimation

I will deliver a document with my findings of the research I did and ideas I generated from the brainstorming while the prototypes will be either refined into the main project or will be kept separated and organized in a separate folder to make it easier to find.

With my estimation it will take with a minimal amount of work:

- 2 hours for the literature study and community research
- 0.5 hour for reviewing and rewriting findings if necessary to make it a more smooth storytelling experience.
- 1 hour for brainstorming with writing down the ideas I came up with.
- 4 hours for prototyping
- 2 hours for executing the ethical and guideline checks
- 1 hour for writing down the findings of the checks
