# What are the potential benefits of using crosswords as a tool for language learning and cultural exchange?

## Language learning

Language learning is difficult if you don't have the drive for it or it just not used in daily life then it can be even more difficult. See following Hiskey (2016) if one of your parents talks you only in one language and only understands that then you will keep remembering and talking in this language.  
Although, with this experiment the father could still fully understand english but would only speak in Klingon to the child or around the child. Thus when the kid knew only his dad speaks klingon but could still understand english and is not used anywhere else they didn't respond anymore when the father spoke to them in Klingon.  
Which is why that experiment ended but it can give you an insight into why learning languages is important which also ties into the next section about the culture.  
Some of the comments on this are like teach the kid a real language instead of a fictional one but that was not the point for the experiment as it was about if it would be learned like any other normal language or not. Which brings me to the point that although its interesting and was stopped in time you could think if the Klingon was more extensive with words and if the child was fostered with a connection to the Klingon community would the child still keep using it or not while the members can still understand another language like english.

Now how can games help with this following (Cambridge Assessment English, n.d.) a game can help to create an environment where you can learn it more easily due to Narrative, Purposeful interactions, Emotional engagement, Freedom to fail and Independent decision making. The game talked about in this is minecraft with one of their stories made by Cambridge which gives mostly kids a good way to learn a second language or get better in their own one.

Now with my project I can create  Narrative, Purposeful interactions, Freedom to fail and Independent decision making. Due to having certain categories being for the crossword it creates a narrative and although a bit weak a purposeful interaction with the multiplayer aspect to finish as fast, understand the other person or just plain finishing the puzzle.  
Next to that nothing really happens when you fail and you can choose what you want to learn more about so that satisfies the need of Freedom to fail and Independent decision making.  
A problem that I do foresee is that there is no clear "intrinsic motivation" for a player because of the limit of what can be done with a crossword puzzle where you have words and their hints. Now the multiplayer aspect can help with providing it by another player but its limited to examples like "Good Job, I didn't know that" or "Ah, now I get it".

## Cultural exchange

Culture is significant although some people don't know it because they don't have the experience of it or don't really see it. The problem with this is that unknowingly you can offend somebody due to this ignorance.  
Following Vigild et al. (2025) games can foster social cohesion and driving social change. Furthermore, one of the key points was to Shape culture, heritage and society through this collaborative game jam.

Now for me this means that with my crossword puzzle I can create cultural connection do this being a game and letting people from different cultural aspects fill them in and creating them. An excerpt from Vigild et al. (2025) which I also thought about with my crossword puzzles is the following.

````TXT
The collaboration between the game industry, research, and education holds immense 
potential to create games with meaningful societal, educational, and cultural impact.
````

For me this means that I can make something meaningful that people can use and learn from each other.

### The Culture Clash

With Culture comes sometimes a clash of values for me that means the accepted words that can be entered. following Burridge (n.d.) and Methven (2024) the word `cunt` could be said to be offensive at first it was a regular word but in 1785 it was published in Dictionary of the vulgar tongue meaning “a nasty word for a nasty thing”. Later down the line in the second half of the 19th Century it was less taboo and more expressing mateship and endearment. While in America it's still taboo and can even be given a jail sentence for it.

For my project this then means that I should be aware that this can happen and minimize the risk.

## How it was researched

I researched this document following:  
Literature study to look at papers and articles on why the experience is so important and the benefits of them.  
Community research to see what the community says about how learning most be done.  
Brainstorm is done to quickly check what are the (limited) uses of the crossword aspect with the learning and exchange.  
Ethical Check was used to check what the culture aspect is used for.
