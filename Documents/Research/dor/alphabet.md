# What kinds of alphabets are there and which do I want to support

Following (wysiwyg* Software Design GmbH, n.d.) there are a lot of writing systems used or were used. The oldest (known) that is still used today is Greek and the youngest is Toto which is being used in south asia, between the border of India and Bhutan.

So now that I have all writing systems I should look for those that I want to use. I will choose it based on the population, is it currently used, is it a real language or a fictional one like klingon and lastly if I think it can be used in the crosswords.  
Which means are there enough words can it be possible to connect words together with each other with mixing or without.

These requirements are made to filter them and not have it be overfull with writing systems that nobody is going to use or only a few people.  
Following that I can make sure that there is no need for larger storage or maintenance of language that only a few are going to use.

## How did I research it

I used the methods of Literature study, Community research and Brainstorm.
I first found some sources where I can find all the writing systems in the world.  
I also looked at what does the language community learn see Duolingo for an example.  
With the brainstorm method I looked at how many do I want to support which will likely impact the most to help learn the language or culture of the writing system.

## What Writing systems are being used today

I will follow (wysiwyg* Software Design GmbH, n.d.) with finding all systems that are being used to today.

## Is it a real language or fictional and are there enough people

Most of them are real writing systems used. Now with looking at the people there are a bunch of systems that are used by a few villages or a small region so these could be better not used.  
So, I will be looking for if there are enough people using this by looking at the amount of people and the region/countries it's used.  

For example Armenian is used by Armenia only but it's a country so for me this satisfies the need to add it to support it. But Ahom is still used but mostly for religious scriptures in current day India (formally Ahom kingdom following (Wikipedia contributors, 2025)).  

- **Adlam** used in Fulani communities, and is currently taught in Guinea, Nigeria, Liberia and other nearby countries. Thus I can consider it
- **Afaka** is a type of english-based creole in suriname because of it having 10% literacy rate I will discredit it from my list.
- **Ahom** ìs for religious chants so I will not continue with this language.
- **Arabic** is the third most widespread official language after english and french. So, it qualifies to take with it.
- **Armenian** is used in Armenia and thus it qualifies for now.
- **Avestan** is more used to transcribe surviving manuscripts by the Zoroastrians of India. So I will not take it further.
- **Avoiuli** is used only by the Turaga indigenous movement on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu. Due to this I will not take it further.
- **Badagda** is used by the Badaga people of the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu in India. So I will also not take this further due to the scope it has.
- **Balinese** is used in Bali and Lombok in indonesia as these are multiple islands I will allow it to be included for now.
- **Bamum** as it was disused in 1931 and revived in 2006 I would say not a lot of people use it. So it will not be included.
- **Bassa Vah** is a failed script and not used a lot today. But the spoken language is used in Liberia in various counties by 733.000 people in 2020. So, I will still say that the script is not used by a lot due to that I will not include it.
- **Batak** is currently being used by several million people on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. So I will include it
- **Bengali** is used by over 265 million people around the world. The sole national script of bangladesh and one of india's national scripts. Due to this it will included further down.
- **Beria** is not used a lot with a total of 169,000 people in Chad and Sudan speaking it and not a lot of writing for it. So it will not be included.
- **Bété** is seen with limited use and by the speakers. So it will not be included.
- **Blissymbols** is a script of symbols so it will not be used as there can't be made words with it for a crossword.
- **Bopomofo** is used to teach the chinese mandarin pronunciation in Taiwan. So, it will not be used due the nature of it.
- **Borama** is only used by a small group of the Sheikh in Borama. So due to the low population I will not include it.
- **Braille patterns** is used by blind readers primarily but only psychical. It can be a fun challenge in a crossword so I will include it.
- **Buginese** has a very limited use in everyday life so I will not include it.
- **Buhid**  is currently only used by a small group of indigenous people from mangyans on the island of Mindoro. Due to this I will not include it.

Of course every script can be written in another but due to it having multiple script that can be used I will choose the way it will limit the scripts to the minimal amount. To have a better way to maintain the scripts.
- **Cham**  is used by the original inhabitants of Vietnam and Cambodia which totals to 245,000 people. So I will include it further down.
- **Cherokee** due to that children that speak cherokee will first learn to put into roman letters and then later writing it in the cherokee script I will say that I will not incorporate it due to them first learning the roman letters for it.
- **Chisoi** as it used to write Kurmali which is usually written with the Devanagari, Odia, Bengali or Latin alphabets I will not include it.

- **Nisu** like Nasu it's one of the chinese writing systems but for the southern side. Due to the same reason I will not include it.
- **Sani Yi** is also a chinese writing system but this is used in all of china. Due to this I will include it.
- **Sunuwar** is being used by 40 thousand people so due to this low amount of use it will not be included.
- **Tangsa** is a writing system used by about 70 sub-tribes on the border of india and myanmar. It's also used by less then 100 thousand people. So due to this I will not include it.
- **Tangsa (Khimhun)** is a sub variant of the regular Tangsa script and due to this I will not include it.
- **Tikamuli** is quite a new writing system due it being created in 2005. The main region where its being used is eastern nepal. Due to this I will not include it.
- **Tani** is also quite the new writing system as it being created in 2001. Following ScriptSource - Tani, n.d. it also has limited use. So, due to this I will not include it.
- **Wancho** is another new writing system created in 2001. Also seeing that only limited material in the writing system is created I will not include it.
- **Osage** is the next new language it being created in 2006. Also only 300 people are learning the language due to this I will not include it.
- **Toto** is a really new writing system it being created in 2015 to write the spoken toto language. It's also an endangered language so not a lot of people are using it so I will not include it to limiting the writing systems.

## Is it in Unicode

I will write every writing system that is also included in Unicode as this is my main method of translating the different scripts and so people don't have to install any special scripts to see the scripts and play them. It also helps that for databases its a basic requirement to support it.

**Adlam**, **Arabic**, **Armenian**, **Balinese**,  
**Batak**, **Bengali**, **Braille patterns**, **Cham**,  
**Cyrillic**, **Devanagari**, **Ethiopic**, **Georgian**,  
**Greek**, **Gujarati**, **Gurmukhi**, **Han**,  
**Hangul**, **Hanifi Rohingya**,**Hebrew**, **Hiragana**,  
**International Phonetic Alphabet**, **Kannada**,**Katakana**, **Khmer**,  
**Lao**, **Latin**, **Limbu**, **Sinhala**,  
**Myanmar**, **Tai Le**, **Sutton Signwriting**, **Hanifi Rohingya**,  
**New Tai Lue**

## Scoping the language

I will limit it to between 4 and 10 writing scripts and will start with 2 writing scripts but will be expanded to include more later down the line if I have the time.

I will pick Latin because of how many are using it and Hiragana because this is one of the systems I'm trying to learn in my free time and current modern people like to go to Japan according to Blanco (2024).

The writing systems like Braille, signwriting and the Phonetic Alphabet are writing systems that are not specifically language specific but would give a cool challenge.

Furthermore the languages I will stick with are:  
**Arabic**, **Braille patterns**, **Han**, **Hangul**,  
**Hiragana**, **International Phonetic Alphabet**, **Katakana**, **Latin**,  
**Sutton Signwriting**,
