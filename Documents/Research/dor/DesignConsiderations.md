# What design considerations do I need to keep in mind

I want to mention before I go into this document that I would think it would be bit simpler but now afterwards I see that you need to look out for all sorts of issues. I followed mainly a literature study, where I also looked into the community for the culture and ethical way of the design based on that. So following that I did a quick guideline conformity analysis and followed it and will be kept like that.

## What happens with design with multiple writing systems

Following Burkhard.Berg (2024) the most common issues that you will face are the cultural aspects like the color, symbols and formatting of data like time, numbers and region prices.
you also have issues like formatting of text that is weird because of the other writing script or language and readability of the text.

Other things also said by Burkhard.Berg (2024) like how to structure the url, subdomains, how mobile users can switch language and SEO are issues that are real but will not be fully taken into account for this project as I don't focus on the mobile part and I don't plan to switch it to a certain domain or let it be searched up.

see Jamous (2006) said that the most common international issues are embedded text in graphics, symbols and locale specific content (such as time, price), sort order like brushstrokes instead of the "alphabet". Furthermore the content style is also different like do they want to do everything from one screen or do they like separated pages.  

### Other reading style

Examples that have other reading styles then the classic left to right is with Arabic reading from right to left, japanese can be also read from right to bottom and then to the left.

## Cultural influence on design

see Burkhard.Berg (2024) the colors have different meanings like red it will be for eastern people it will be 'happiness', 'good fortune'. In the western side it will be 'passion', 'love', 'anger', 'stop'. And then finally for the Middle east it's only 'danger', 'caution', 'evil' or similar. While the color Purple has across the same meaning of wealth and royalty.

So this means that I can't put the color red for eastern people like a delete button because it's not associated ( based on the color) that you need to watch out for this button as it can't be undone. So something else needs to be done to warn them like a different color or no color at all but a simple trashbin symbol for all of them.

## What should be done

So in conclusion what should be done is that you keep in mind that you use widely accepted things like a Mail symbol instead of a mailbox, know the meaning of colors based on the generalized culture meaning and that you make it clear how the time, date and currency is displayed. Furthermore you should test with the other writing script or even the languages how different the website can feel.

## In my project

Now based on the previous things I looked overall how the website feels and that I follow the guidelines that I said in the previous paragraph, I looked at how the text is shown and used the color to see if I can give the correct meaning and due to not having date or other data value that needs to be converted I didn't need to change it.
